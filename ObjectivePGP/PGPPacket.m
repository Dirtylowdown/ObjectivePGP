//    4.1.  Overview
//
//    An OpenPGP message is constructed from a number of records that are
//    traditionally called packets.  A packet is a chunk of data that has a
//    tag specifying its meaning.  An OpenPGP message, keyring,
//    certificate, and so forth consists of a number of packets.  Some of
//    those packets may contain other OpenPGP packets (for example, a
//    compressed data packet, when uncompressed, contains OpenPGP packets).
//
//    Each packet consists of a packet header, followed by the packet body.
//    The packet header is of variable length.
